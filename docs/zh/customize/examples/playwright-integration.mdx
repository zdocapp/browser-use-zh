## 核心功能

1. Browser-Use 和 Playwright 通过 CDP 共享同一个 Chrome 实例
2. 使用 Playwright 执行操作后继续使用 Browser-Use 操作
3. 让代理调用 Playwright 函数，如截图或点击选择器，实现确定性步骤

## 安装

```bash
uv pip install playwright aiohttp
```

## 完整示例

```python
import asyncio
import os
import subprocess
import sys
import tempfile

# Check for required dependencies first - before other imports
try:
	import aiohttp  # type: ignore
	from playwright.async_api import Browser, Page, async_playwright  # type: ignore

	print('This example requires: playwright aiohttp')
	print('Install with: uv add playwright aiohttp')
	print('Also run: playwright install chromium')
